      "Create a NEW LLM resource (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) in a project. This is a LAST RESORT — only use when no existing LLM can be reused.\n\nPRECONDITION — you MUST have already completed ALL of these before calling this tool:\n1. Listed all projects: list_resources { resourceType: 'project' }\n2. Checked every other project for existing LLMs: list_resources { resourceType: 'llm_model', projectId }\n3. Attempted package reuse where another project already has a reusable LLM with connectionId\n4. Proceeding only because reuse is unavailable, transfer failed, or the user explicitly asked for a brand-new LLM\nIf you have not completed steps 1-4, STOP and do them first. Do NOT call this tool.\n\nMODEL ROLE WARNING:\n- Chat/completion models are used for AI Agents.\n- Embedding models are used for knowledge-store indexing.\n- Knowledge Search and Answer Extraction use same-project llm_model IDs accepted by the Cognigy API for that use case.\n- Do not use setup_llm as an automatic workaround for knowledgeSearchModelId failures while existing same-project candidates still exist.\n\nOPENAI-COMPATIBLE PROVIDERS (self-hosted or third-party endpoints that speak the OpenAI API, e.g. vLLM, Hugging Face, LiteLLM, Azure AI Foundry): use provider 'openAICompatible' with modelType 'custom-model' (chat) or 'custom-embedding-model' (embedding). The actual model name goes in customModel and the endpoint in baseCustomUrl — both required. Optional: customAuthHeader (send the API key in a custom header instead of 'Authorization: Bearer'), apiType ('chatCompletion' default, or 'responses').\n\nIMPORTANT: NEVER guess or hallucinate API keys. If creating a new LLM and no apiKey or connectionId was provided by the user, ASK for the required credentials.\n\nAfter creation, the connection is normally tested by sending a minimal probe to the provider. If this connection test runs and fails (for example, invalid credentials or model name), the model is deleted and an error is returned — this prevents broken model references from silently breaking downstream flows.\n\nIf the provider's test endpoint is unreachable or returns a non-testable status, the model is kept but a warning is returned so you know connectivity could not be fully verified.\n\nIf dangerouslySkipConnectionTest is true, the connection test is not run at all; the model is kept and the response includes a warning that no connectivity check was performed. Only use this flag when you explicitly accept the risk that the created LLM might not be callable. Never use it to bypass a missing or cross-project connection.\n\nIf isDefault is true (the default), agents in the project will automatically use this LLM. If isDefault is false, you must explicitly assign it to the agent via update_ai_agent { aiAgentId, jobConfig: { llmProviderReferenceId: '<referenceId from this response>' } }.\n\nThe response includes the LLM's referenceId — use this value for jobConfig.llmProviderReferenceId if assigning manually.\n\nTo list existing LLMs: use list_resources { resourceType: 'llm_model', projectId }.\nTo delete: use delete_resource { resourceType: 'llm_model', id }.",

Packages are handled through manage_packages.\n\nUse `sort` for recency questions instead of paging through everything: `sort: 'lastChanged:desc', limit: 5` answers \"which project was touched most recently\" in one call.

Note: because the agent still exists (renamed), re-running create_ai_agent with the original name creates a NEW agent.\n\nFLOW 'DELETION' also deactivates every endpoint referencing the flow before renaming it.

  // 9. create_tool
  {
    name: "create_tool",
    description: `Create a tool as a child of an AI Agent's Job node. Tools extend what the agent can do.

IMPORTANT — environment-specific conventions that are NOT obvious from this schema and that silently produce broken tools when missed: the wrapped HTTP response shape (input.httprequest is an object containing { result, statusCode, length }, NOT the raw response body), where LLM tool-call arguments live (input.aiAgent.toolArgs.<param>, NOT input.data), and Code-node rules (top-level return is forbidden — mutate input directly). Assuming "REST is obvious" or "Code nodes are just JS" is the most common cause of HTTP tools that fire successfully but return empty results to the LLM.

Tool types:
- tool: General-purpose tool with custom logic branch. Use this for most requests (e.g., "unlock account", "check status", "validate input"). Provide toolId, description, and optional parameters (JSON Schema). After creation, use manage_flow_nodes with parentNodeId = returned toolNodeId and mode = "appendChild" to add logic nodes (say, code, ifThenElse, httpRequest, etc.) inside the tool branch.
- knowledge: Search a Knowledge Store. Provide knowledgeStoreId, toolId, description.
- send_email: Send emails. Provide toolId, description, recipient.
- mcp: Connect to an EXTERNAL MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. ONLY use when the user explicitly asks to integrate with a specific external MCP server and provides an MCP server URL. Do NOT use for general tool requests — use "tool" or "http" instead.
- http: Call an external HTTP API. Use when the user wants to call a specific REST/HTTP endpoint. Provide toolId, description, url, method, and optionally headers, body, preProcessCode, postProcessCode. Creates an aiAgentJobTool with child HTTP Request node (and optional pre/post-process Code nodes).

Default choice: When unsure which toolType to use, default to "tool" (general-purpose). Only use "mcp" or "http" when the user specifically mentions an external MCP server or a specific HTTP API endpoint.

IMPORTANT: Create exactly one tool per business action. If the same toolId already exists, create_tool reuses the existing tool node instead of creating a duplicate. If you need more logic for that action, reuse the same toolNodeId with manage_flow_nodes or update_tool.

Prerequisites: Agent must exist (created via create_ai_agent).
To list tools: list_resources { resourceType: 'tool', aiAgentId }.
To delete: delete_resource { resourceType: 'tool', id: toolId, aiAgentId }.
After creating, use talk_to_agent to test.`,

      'Manage the logic nodes inside a flow (list/get/create/update/delete) and render the flow as a diagram. Nodes are helpers that live INSIDE AI Agent tool branches: create a tool first (create_tool { toolType: "tool" }), then add nodes with parentNodeId = toolNodeId, mode = "appendChild". NEVER add standalone nodes before the AI Agent Job node. The flow-nodes skill owns the full workflow — placement, branching (ifThenElse/lookup), node config, and case values.\n\nOPERATIONS:\n- list: all nodes in a flow (id, type, label, parentId, isEntryPoint only — NO config).\n- get: one node in full incl. config (requires nodeId). Read before editing. For code nodes the config reports `hasError`; the large server-computed `transpiled` output is omitted.\n- create: add a node (requires nodeType + config). parentNodeId + mode place it — see the flow-nodes skill.\n- update: change a node\'s config or label (only provided fields change). For switch/lookup nodes, pass a `cases` array to set case values.\n- delete: remove a node.\n- render (read-only): visualize the flow. Returns an `ascii` tree (display inline in any client incl. terminal) and a `mermaid` string. Deliver the mermaid ONLY as a native Mermaid/diagram artifact — do NOT wrap it in HTML or paste it as an inline ```mermaid fence (both break the zoomable, mobile-friendly viewer). Options: focus=<nodeId|nodeId[]> highlights nodes; writeHtml writes a self-contained rich HTML graph to a local tmp file and opens it in the browser (returns htmlUrl/htmlPath — the file is already on the user\'s machine, just hand them the link). See the flow-nodes skill for details.\n\nSupported node types come from the server node registry; an unsupported nodeType returns the current list. For AI Agent tool nodes (knowledge, send_email, mcp, http) use create_tool / update_tool instead.',

    name: "manage_snapshots",
    description:
      'Create and restore Cognigy Snapshots so agent changes can be rolled back. A Snapshot is an immutable copy of a PROJECT.\n\nBACKUP OPERATIONS:\n- list: list the project\'s snapshots, flagging which ones this plugin created, plus the current count against the snapshot limit\n- create: create a backup snapshot of the project and wait for the task to finish\n- restore: roll the project back to a snapshot (reports a preflight first; only acts with confirm: true)\n- delete: delete a snapshot — ONLY snapshots this plugin created\n- decline: record that the user was asked for a backup and said no (for that projectId only — another project is asked about separately)\n- read_task: read task status for a create, restore, or delete that outlived the wait\n\nWHEN TO USE:\n- The FIRST attempt to change an existing agent in a session is HELD by the server: it changes NOTHING and returns error \"backup_not_offered\". Ask the user whether they want a backup, then call create (yes) or decline (no), then retry the held call.\n- When the user wants to undo, call restore (preflight), show the warnings, get agreement, then restore with confirm: true.\n\nSCOPE — A SNAPSHOT IS PROJECT-WIDE:\n- It captures every AI Agent, Flow, Connection, LLM, Lexicon, Extension, Function, Playbook and Locale in the project. Restoring reverts ALL of them, not just one agent.\n- It does NOT contain Endpoints, Knowledge AI (stores/sources/chunks), Intent Trainer records, analytics, contact profiles, logs, or other snapshots. A RAG agent restored from a snapshot comes back WITHOUT its knowledge. Say so before creating or restoring.\n\nRESTORE IS DESTRUCTIVE:\n- All current project resources are DELETED and recreated from the snapshot. Resource ids change, so re-list resources afterwards.\n- Endpoints survive but their locale references are rewritten; endpoints on non-primary locales need manual repair in the UI.\n- restore without confirm: true performs NO action — it returns a preflight report. Show it to the user and get explicit agreement before retrying with confirm: true.\n\nSNAPSHOT LIMIT (default 10 per project, configurable per installation):\n- create pre-checks the count. At the limit it creates NOTHING and returns error "snapshot_limit_reached" plus the oldest deletable backup.\n- Ask the user whether to free a slot, then retry with confirmDeleteOldest: true, which deletes the OLDEST plugin-created backup and then creates.\n- If no plugin-created backup exists to delete, create refuses. The plugin NEVER deletes a human-created snapshot — the user must delete one in the Cognigy UI.\n\nIDENTIFICATION:\n- Snapshots created here are named "[AI Backup] v<N> <label> — <timestamp>" and carry a marker in their description. delete accepts ONLY snapshots with both markers.\n- <N> is a version number that only ever counts up within a project, so a backup can be referred to as "v3" instead of by timestamp. list returns it as `version` (null for snapshots with no version in the name).\n\nBEHAVIOR:\n- create/restore/delete are async platform tasks. By default this tool waits for completion (waitForCompletion: true) and returns the final task state.\n- Snapshot names must be unique in a project; the timestamp in the generated name guarantees that. Pass a short `label`, never a full name.\n- Downloading, packaging and uploading snapshots are deliberately NOT supported here.\n\nOUTCOMES THAT ARE NOT YET KNOWN:\n- If a task was started but its status could not be read, the result carries error \"task_status_unknown\" and outcomeUnknown: true. The operation MAY have succeeded — do NOT report it as failed and do NOT retry it. Poll read_task with the returned taskId first. On create, `created` is null rather than false on this path, because whether the backup exists is not yet known.\n- restore and delete verify the snapshot belongs to the passed projectId. A snapshotId from another project returns error \"snapshot_project_mismatch\" and changes nothing.\n- If freeing a slot cannot be confirmed, create returns error \"eviction_incomplete\" and stops: no further backup is deleted and no snapshot is created. Poll the task in haltedOn, then list before retrying.',
