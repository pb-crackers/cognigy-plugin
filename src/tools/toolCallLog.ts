/**
 * Tool-call logging.
 *
 * An AI Agent decides which tool to run and with what arguments, and nothing
 * in the flow records that decision. When a conversation goes wrong the first
 * question is always "which tool did it actually call, and with what?" — and
 * without a log the answer has to be inferred from the agent's prose.
 *
 * A Log node at the HEAD of every tool branch answers it. The head, not the
 * tail: a log at the end only fires if the branch completes, so the calls that
 * most need explaining — the ones that threw, timed out, or hung — are exactly
 * the ones that would leave no trace.
 *
 * **Parameter names are logged; values are not.** Tool arguments routinely
 * carry personal data (a mortgage intake tool takes a name, an email, a phone
 * number and the last four of an SSN), and project logs are not the place for
 * it. The names are what identify the call; the values are what create the
 * liability. Anyone who needs values can add their own node and own that
 * decision explicitly.
 */

/**
 * Where tool-call arguments live depends on which node invoked the tool:
 * `input.aiAgent` under an AI Agent Job node, `input.llmPrompt` under an LLM
 * Prompt node — and the other object is null, so reading only one silently
 * yields nothing under the other.
