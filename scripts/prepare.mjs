// npm `prepare` hook. Runs in two very different situations:
//
//  1. Local development (`npm install` in a clone) — install the husky hooks.
//  2. A git install (`npx -p github:pb-crackers/cognigy-plugin cognigy-mcp`)
//     — npm clones this repo, installs devDependencies, and runs `prepare`.
//     There is no published tarball and therefore no `dist/`, so the TypeScript
//     has to be compiled here or the `cognigy-mcp` bin (dist/index.js) will not
//     exist and the MCP server fails to boot with -32000.
//
// Neither step may hard-fail the other: husky is absent/irrelevant in a git
// install (no .git in the extracted copy), and rebuilding on every local
// install would be wasted work when dist is already present.
