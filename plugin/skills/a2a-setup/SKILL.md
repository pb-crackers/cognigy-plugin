# A2A (Agent2Agent) Setup Guide

## When NOT to use A2A

**Several agents in the same project are not a reason to use A2A.** If the user wants agents in one project to work together ("connect these two agents", "let the triage agent hand off to the billing agent"), use Cognigy's native **Handover to AI Agent** tool on the calling AI Agent node. It transfers the conversation to another AI Agent in the same or a different Flow and keeps the conversation context. A2A would instead publish an endpoint, add an Agent Card, auth and network latency, and run the target as a separate conversation.

This plugin cannot create a Handover to AI Agent tool yet. Tell the user to add it in the Cognigy UI (AI Agent node → Tools → Add Tool → Handover to AI Agent). Don't build an A2A setup as a workaround.

Use A2A only when at least one of these holds:

- The target agent is **outside the project**: an external or third-party A2A agent, another team's deployment, another project or tenant.
- The user wants to **expose a Cognigy agent to outside callers** over A2A.
- The user **explicitly asks for A2A** by name.

If it's unclear whether the user means in-project handover or A2A, ask.

## Read this first

- **`manage_a2a_server` publishes a callable endpoint.** With `authenticationType: "none"` anyone who has the URL can call the agent. Confirm with the user before you create one, and tell them that.
- **Gotcha (Cognigy targets only):** a `manage_a2a_server` endpoint lives at `/a2a/v1/<URLToken>`, not the plain endpoint URL. Always copy `agentBaseUrl` straight from that tool's response — don't build it yourself. External/third-party agents don't have this quirk; just use whatever base URL they publish.
- **Always check `liveCheck`** on the `manage_a2a_server` response before telling the user the agent is ready — `created: true` alone doesn't mean it's callable yet. Every create/update fetches the Agent Card live and returns `liveCheck.reachable`. This works for API-key endpoints too: the key guards message requests, not the Agent Card.

## What is A2A here?

Two independent pieces — you rarely need both:

1. **`create_tool { toolType: 'a2a' }`** — adds a tool to ANY agent that calls a remote A2A agent. The remote agent can be **anything that speaks A2A**: a third-party service, another team's deployment, a public demo agent — you just need its base URL (and Agent Card path). This is the piece you almost always want, and it needs nothing Cognigy-specific on the remote side.
2. **`manage_a2a_server`** — ONLY needed when the agent you want to expose *as an A2A target for others* is itself a Cognigy agent you're building. It deploys a Flow as a remote-callable A2A agent with an Agent Card (name, description, skills).

Put differently: `create_tool { toolType: 'a2a' }` is the generic "call any A2A agent" client. `manage_a2a_server` is specifically "make one of my own Cognigy agents callable that way" — use it only when a Cognigy agent has to be reachable over A2A from outside its project (an external orchestrator, another project or tenant). Two agents in the same project don't need it (see "When NOT to use A2A").

## Quick Start — Delegate to an EXTERNAL A2A agent (the common case)

No Cognigy setup needed on the remote side — just its base URL:

```text
create_tool {
  aiAgentId: "<orchestrator aiAgentId>",
  toolType: "a2a",
  name: "Weather Agent",
  config: {
    agentBaseUrl: "https://some-external-a2a-agent.example.com",
    agentCardPath: ".well-known/agent.json",
    executionMode: "blocking",
    taskTimeout: 60
  }
}
```

`agentBaseUrl` here is whatever base URL the external agent's own documentation/Agent Card publishes — nothing to construct, nothing from this plugin. Only when the remote agent happens to be a Cognigy agent you're also standing up does the URL need the `/a2a/v1/` shape covered below.

## Quick Start — Deploy YOUR OWN Cognigy agent as an A2A server

Only do this when a Cognigy agent you're building must be callable over A2A from outside its project, for example by an external orchestrator or an agent in another project or tenant. If the caller is in the same project, use Handover to AI Agent instead:

```text
1. create_ai_agent { projectId, name: "Flights Agent", description: "Books and looks up flights" }
2. (configure persona/instructions, attach tools as normal)
3. manage_a2a_server {
     projectId: "...",
     flowId: "<flow referenceId>",
     name: "Flights Agent A2A Server",
     agentName: "Flights Agent",
     agentDescription: "Books flights and checks flight status",
     skills: [
       { id: "book-flight", name: "book-flight", description: "Book a flight between two cities" },
       { id: "check-flight-status", name: "check-flight-status", description: "Check the status of a booked flight" }
     ],
     enableStreaming: true
   }
   → returns agentBaseUrl, agentCardUrl, and liveCheck — CHECK liveCheck.reachable before telling the user it's ready
```

Then wire the caller to it exactly like the external case above, using the returned `agentBaseUrl` VERBATIM:

```text
create_tool {
  aiAgentId: "<orchestrator aiAgentId>",
  toolType: "a2a",
  name: "Flights Agent",
  config: {
    agentBaseUrl: "<agentBaseUrl from manage_a2a_server response, VERBATIM>",
    agentCardPath: ".well-known/agent.json",
    executionMode: "blocking",
    taskTimeout: 60
  }
}
```

The orchestrator's description/instructions should mention it can delegate to registered specialist agents — the LLM decides when to call the `a2a` tool the same way it decides when to call any other tool, based on the tool's `name` and the remote agent's `agentDescription`/skills.

CREATE vs UPDATE (manage_a2a_server): same pattern as manage_webchat/manage_voice_gateway — omit `endpointId` + provide `projectId`+`flowId` to create; provide `endpointId` to update (settings merge with existing).

## Agent Card (manage_a2a_server settings)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| agentName | string | Name shown to remote callers in this agent's Agent Card |
| agentDescription | string | What this agent does — the main signal a remote orchestrator's LLM uses to decide whether to delegate here |
| skills | array | `{ id, name, description }` — the specific capabilities this agent exposes. Give each a unique `id` |
| enableStreaming | boolean | Stream partial results back to the caller |
| authenticationType | "none" \| "apiKey" | How callers must authenticate to this endpoint |

Response fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| agentBaseUrl | `https://endpoint-<env>.cognigy.ai/a2a/v1/<URLToken>` — use this verbatim as `agentBaseUrl` on the calling side |
| agentCardUrl | `agentBaseUrl + '/.well-known/agent.json'` — the discovery URL the Agent Card is actually served from |
| liveCheck | Result of fetching agentCardUrl right now: `{ reachable: true, agentName, skills }` or `{ reachable: false, error }` |

## A2A Agent tool config (create_tool / update_tool)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| agentBaseUrl | string | Base URL of the remote agent — use a `manage_a2a_server` response's `agentBaseUrl` verbatim, or any third-party A2A agent's own base URL |
| agentCardPath | string | Path to the Agent Card, appended to agentBaseUrl. Default: `.well-known/agent.json` |
| timeout | number | Discovery (Agent Card fetch) timeout in seconds |
| executionMode | string | How the delegated task runs. Default: `blocking` (wait for the remote agent's final result) |
| taskTimeout | number | Max seconds to wait for the remote task to complete |
| maxAutonomousTurns | number | How many times the AI Agent may call this tool in one turn (1-10). Default: 4 |
| toolFilter | "none" \| "whitelist" \| "blacklist" | Which of the remote agent's skills are listed in this tool's description. NOT an access control: the node stays one tool and the remote agent still decides which skills it runs |
| whitelist / blacklist | string[] | Skill ids to list / leave out of the tool description, when toolFilter is set |
| authType | "none" \| "apiKey" \| "bearer" \| "basic" \| "oAuth2" | Auth method for calling the remote agent |
| apiKeyConnection / bearerConnection / basicConnection / oAuth2Connection | string | Cognigy Connection ID holding the credential for the matching authType |
| apiKeyHeader | string | Header name for apiKey auth. Default: `X-API-Key`. For a Cognigy a2aServer target set `x-a2a-endpoint-key`; its key is generated in the Cognigy UI (endpoint → Authentication → Endpoint API Keys) |
| authForDiscovery | boolean | Also authenticate when fetching the Agent Card, not just when calling tasks |
| agentHeaders | string | Extra HTTP headers as a JSON string |
| cacheCard | boolean | Cache the discovered Agent Card instead of re-fetching every call. Default: true |

Node structure created: `aiAgentJobA2AAgent` (the tool node the LLM sees, config above) with a child `aiAgentJobCallA2AAgent` node (fixed config, handles the actual call — no need to touch it directly).

## Multi-agent orchestrator pattern

This pattern is for when the specialists must be reachable over A2A, for example from outside the project, or because the user asked for A2A. When the orchestrator and specialists all live in one project and nobody outside needs to reach them, use Handover to AI Agent instead (see "When NOT to use A2A").

```text
1. Create + configure each specialist agent (create_ai_agent, tools, persona)
2. Deploy each specialist behind its own manage_a2a_server endpoint —
   check liveCheck.reachable on each before proceeding
3. Create the orchestrator agent (create_ai_agent) with a persona describing
   it delegates to registered specialist agents
4. For each specialist, add one create_tool { toolType: "a2a" } on the
   orchestrator, using that specialist's agentBaseUrl verbatim
5. Optionally deploy the orchestrator itself behind manage_a2a_server, so
   it becomes callable as a top-level "main" A2A entry point
6. Test each specialist directly with talk_to_agent first (isolate config
   issues from delegation issues), then test the orchestrator
```

## Prerequisites

- Each agent (specialist and orchestrator) must be created via `create_ai_agent` — `manage_a2a_server` and `create_tool` both require the auto-provisioned flow.
- An LLM must be configured for every agent involved, including specialists — the orchestrator's A2A call still lands on a real agent conversation on the other end.
- Before wiring the orchestrator, verify each specialist responds correctly via `talk_to_agent` on its own REST/webchat endpoint.
