## Model groups

`setup_llm` can create different kinds of Cognigy LLM resources. The important distinction is the `modelType`:

- Chat models: used for AI Agents, Knowledge Search, and Answer Extraction.
  Examples: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1`, `claude-sonnet-4-0`, `gemini-2.0-flash`, `mistral-small-2503`.
- Embedding models: used for knowledge-store vector indexing.
  Examples: `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, `text-embedding-ada-002`, `luminous-embedding-128`, `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`, `Pharia-1-Embedding-4608`, `gemini-embedding-001`, `custom-embedding-model`.

Chat/completion models are not embedding models. `gpt-4o-mini` is a chat model, not a valid embedding-model choice for knowledge-store indexing.

When using `list_resources { resourceType: "llm_model", projectId }`, inspect the returned `modelType` and select the model by its exact role. Do not infer that all LLMs are interchangeable.

## OpenAI-compatible providers (openAICompatible)

Use provider `openAICompatible` for ANY endpoint that speaks the OpenAI API but is not OpenAI itself: vLLM, Hugging Face, LiteLLM, Groq, Together AI, Azure AI Foundry (model router), or self-hosted deployments. Do NOT mislabel these as `openAI` — without a base URL the connection test hits api.openai.com and fails.

Required parameters:

- `modelType`: exactly `custom-model` (chat) or `custom-embedding-model` (embedding) — never the real model name
- `customModel`: the model name as known by the provider, e.g. `llama-3.3-70b-instruct`
- `baseCustomUrl`: the provider's OpenAI-compatible base URL, e.g. `https://my-llm-host.example.com/v1`
- `apiKey` (or a same-project `connectionId`)

Optional parameters:

- `customAuthHeader`: custom HTTP header name for authentication (e.g. `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`). When set, the API key is sent in that header instead of `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.
- `apiType`: `chatCompletion` (default) or `responses` — only use `responses` if the provider supports OpenAI's Responses API.

Example:

```json
{
  "projectId": "<projectId>",
  "provider": "openAICompatible",
  "modelType": "custom-model",
  "customModel": "llama-3.3-70b-instruct",
  "baseCustomUrl": "https://my-llm-host.example.com/v1",
  "apiKey": "<key>"
}
```

Notes:

- The Completions API for custom LLMs is deprecated (removal planned for Cognigy.AI 2026.24.0) — use Chat Completions or Responses.
- When inspecting existing models via `list_resources` / `get_resource`, openAI-compatible models show `modelType: "custom-model"`; the real model name and endpoint are in the `openAICompatible` object (`customModel`, `baseCustomUrl`, `customAuthHeader`).

## AWS Bedrock (awsBedrock)

Use provider `awsBedrock` for models hosted on AWS Bedrock (Amazon Nova, Anthropic Claude on Bedrock, Titan embeddings).

Required parameters:

- `region`: AWS region of the Bedrock deployment, e.g. `us-east-1`
- `modelType`: a Bedrock model id from Cognigy's supported list — chat: `amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`, `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`, `amazon.nova-micro-v1:0`, `amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`; embedding: `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`. For any other Bedrock model (including Claude) use `custom-model` and put the model id — or an inference profile id like `eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` — in `customModel`. Cognigy's list changes with platform releases (`anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0` was removed in 2026.10); check the deprecations table in the docs if a named id is rejected.
- Credentials — one of (NOT `apiKey`):
  - `accessKeyId` + `secretAccessKey` (access-key auth → `AwsBedrockProvider` connection) — the standard option, works everywhere
  - `roleArn` (IAM-role auth → `AwsBedrockProviderIamRole` connection) — feature-gated: only works when the Cognigy installation has IAM connections enabled for the organisation (`FEATURE_ENABLE_IAM_AWS_CONNECTION_WHITELIST`); otherwise connection creation is rejected with "This type is not enabled for your installation". Don't steer users here unless they asked for IAM-role auth — default to the key pair.
  - `connectionId` of an existing same-project connection

Optional parameters:

- `location`: inference-call routing — `region` (default; requests stay in the given AWS region), `geo` (routed within a geographic boundary; requires `geo`), or `global` (routed worldwide, highest throughput, no data-residency guarantee)
- `geo`: required when `location` is `geo` — the geographic boundary, e.g. `us`, `eu`, `apac`. The AWS region must lie inside it.

Example:

```json
{
  "projectId": "<projectId>",
  "provider": "awsBedrock",
  "modelType": "amazon.nova-pro-v1:0",
  "region": "eu-central-1",
  "accessKeyId": "<AWS access key id>",
  "secretAccessKey": "<AWS secret access key>"
}
```

When inspecting existing models, the region, routing location/geo, and custom model id are in the `awsBedrock` object of the response.

Caveat: AWS Bedrock rejects requests with an empty or whitespace-only system prompt (HTTP 400). For AI Agents this applies only when persona, job description, AND instructions are all empty — make sure a Bedrock-backed agent has at least one of them filled.

## Credential resolution

- Provide the provider's credentials — a Connection is auto-created, then the LLM resource is linked to it. For most providers that is apiKey; for awsBedrock it is accessKeyId + secretAccessKey or roleArn instead (apiKey is rejected there)
- Provide connectionId (UUID referenceId of an existing Connection in the SAME project, of a type matching the provider) to skip connection creation — never together with inline credentials
- Either the provider's credentials or connectionId is required
- If the only working connection lives in another project, transfer the LLM + connection via manage_packages instead of passing that connectionId directly

## Connection validation

After creating the model, setup_llm automatically tests the connection by sending a minimal probe to the provider. This catches invalid API keys, wrong model types, and misconfigured providers before they can break downstream flows.

- **Test passes**: the response includes `connectionTest.isCredentialsValid: true` and the provider's confirmation message.
- **Test fails**: the model is automatically deleted to prevent broken references, and an error is returned with the provider's error message.
- **Test endpoint unreachable**: the model is kept but a warning is returned advising manual verification.

## Common errors

- "Invalid provider": use exact camelCase strings from the provider column (openAI, not openai)
- "Authentication failed": verify the credentials are valid for that provider (apiKey; or AWS access keys / role ARN for awsBedrock)
- "Model not found": check exact modelType spelling (e.g. gpt-4o, not gpt4o)

## Troubleshooting: dangerouslySkipConnectionTest

If the connection test cannot run in your environment (e.g., air-gapped setup, unsupported custom model provider), you can pass `dangerouslySkipConnectionTest: true` to skip validation. **This is a last resort** — it may leave a non-functional model reference that silently breaks agent conversations and knowledge stores. Always prefer fixing the root cause instead. Do not use this to work around a missing, invalid, or cross-project connection.
